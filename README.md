This is a minimal task manager, you can easily create tasks, update your tasks, and delete them at your convenience. 
Before creating any task, you must be authenticated first.

Curious about what Tasky looks like on the web, well here you have it https://task-manager-abmm-2ikxvz7qn-techsis01.vercel.app/

But if you want to checkout a more robust Task management application, kindly checkout this other version I built as well:  https://taskbuddy-mu.vercel.app/
